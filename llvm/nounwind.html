	<h1>Discussion on the nounwind attribute</h1>

	<p>Logan Chien</p>

	<p>(This is the follow up of the threads: <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-February/070122.html">[LLVMdev] Unwind behaviour in Clang/LLVM</a>)</p>

	<p>I feel that there are two problems with the existing infrastructure:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The <code class="llattr">nounwind</code> attribute is ambiguous
for (1) not throwing exceptions and (2) not performing stack unwinding.  I feel
that it will be better to separate this in two different attributes.</li>

		<li>There is some problem when the function has both
<code class="llattr">uwtable</code> and <code class="llattr">nounwind</code>.
Although, I think it fine to keep the current definition of
<code class="llattr">nounwind</code>, however, the
<code class="llattr">uwtable</code> attribute will be much useless
to its user.  Besides, even if we wish to keep the current definition, to avoid
the undefined behavior, we have to slightly change the code generator to emit
<code>[can't unwind]</code> whenever there is a
<code class="llattr">nounwind</code> attribute.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I am writing my thoughts below, please have a look, and feel free
to challenge or send me the feedback.  Thanks.</p>

	<p>tl;dr</p>

	<h2>Notations</h2>

	<p>To make my argument clear, I would like to use a <em>different</em>
notation from LLVM IR:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The <code class="myattr">no-throw</code> attribute guarantees that
the function will not throw any exception object.</li>

		<li>The <code class="myattr">no-unwind</code> attribute guarantees
that the function won't read the prior calling sequence with the stack
unwinder.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For simplification, if the function is not tagged with
<code>no-throw</code> then it is <em>may-throw</em>.  Similarly, if the
function is not tagged with <code>no-unwind</code>, then it is
<em>may-unwind</em>.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The <code class="myattr">ehtable</code> attribute guarantees that
the exception handling table, such as the LSDA handler data and (by
implementation) the stack unwinding information for exception, will be
generated for exception handling.  If the table includes stack unwinding
infomration, then it is guaranteed that the unwinding information is sufficient
enough to go back to previous propagation barrier (landingpad, cleanup filter,
or can't unwind.)</li>

		<li>The <code class="myattr">uwtable</code> attribute guarantees that
the unwind table will be generated for stack unwinding for profilers,
debuggers, (possibly) exception handling mechansim and etc.  This attribute
guarantees that the complete stack trace can be obtained as long as the calling
sequence does not contain  the external function or the function marked with
<code>no-unwind</code>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It is possible for some exception handling implemenation requires <code
class="myattr">uwtable</code> to unwind the stack, it is not necessary to do
so.  On the other hand, even if the stack unwind information for exception
handling is encoded in <code class="myattr">ehtable</code>, it might be
insufficient to implement the stack unwinder.  We will come back with this
later.</p>

	<p>If a function has both <code class="myattr">no-uwnind</code> and
<code class="myattr">uwtable</code>, then there must be a mechanism
(might be an agreement between the compiler and the run-time library) to
signal the stack unwinder to stop before passing through the function.
Otherwise, the undefined behavior might be happened.  Similarly, we
need a similar mechanism for the function with both
<code class="myattr">no-throw</code> and
<code class="myattr">ehtable</code></p>

	<p>With these notations, we can do some simple <em>reasoning</em>:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><em>may-throw</em> implies <em>may-unwind</em> &mdash;
We have to unwind the stack if the exception is thrown by the function, thus
the <em>may-throw</em> attribute will imply <em>may-unwind</em>.</li>

		<li><code class="myattr">no-unwind</code> implies
<code class="myattr">no-throw</code> &mdash; The contraposition to the previous
statement.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Please notice that <code class="myattr">no-throw</code> does not imply
<code class="myattr">no-unwind</code>.  We will come back with this later.</p>

	<h2>Attribute Properties</h2>

	<p>In this section, I would like to discuss the properties of
<code class="myattr">no-unwind</code> and <code class="myattr">no-throw</code>,
and the rules to infer the attributes if the programmer didn't specified them
in function definition.  These properties may be used by some optimization
passes, such as <code>PruneEH</code>.</p>

	<p>First, since <code class="myattr">no-unwind</code> implies <code
class="myattr">no-throw</code>, we can add <code class="myattr">no-throw</code>
attribute to the functions which have <code class="myattr">no-unwind</code>
attribute.</p>

	<p>Second, it is clear that the external functions should be considered as
<em>may-throw</em> unless it is explicitly tagged with
<code class="myattr">no-throw</code>.  Similarly, the external functions should
be <em>may-unwind</em> unless it is explicitly tagged with
<code class="myattr">no-unwind</code>.</p>


	<p>For function definition, we can inspect the instructions:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If the function does not have any <code>call</code> or
<code>invoke</code> instruction to a <em>may-unwind</em> callee function and
<code>-fasynchronous-unwind-table</code> compiler option isn't given, then we
can add the <code class="myattr">no-unwind</code> attribute to the
function.</li>

		<li>If the function does not have any <code>call</code> or
<code>invoke</code> instruction to a <em>may-throw</em> callee function, then
we can add the <code class="myattr">no-throw</code> attribute to the
function (safe approximation.)</code></li>

		<li>If we can prove that every exceptions are caught by the landing pad
and the function won't re-throw the exception or won't continue the
unwinding, then we can add the <code class="myattr">no-throw</code> to the
function attribute.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Please notice that we have to deliberately separate the attribute
into <code class="myattr">no-throw</code> and
<code class="myattr">no-unwind</code> because the <code>landingpad</code>
instruction can't give any guarantee on <code class="myattr">no-unwind</code>
attribute.</p>

	<h2>Problems with Existing LLVM Infrastructure</h2>

	<p>There are two function attributes related with unwinding and exception
handling in the existing LLVM infrastructure.  Here are the descriptions copied
from the <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM reference
manual</a>:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><code class="llattr">nounwind</code> &mdash; This function
attribute indicates that the function never returns with an unwind or
exceptional control flow. If the function does unwind, its runtime behavior is
undefined.</li>

		<li><code class="llattr">uwtable</code> &mdash; This attribute
indicates that the ABI being targeted requires that an unwind table entry be
produce for this function even if we can show that no exceptions passes by it.
This is normally the case for the ELF x86-64 abi, but it can be disabled for
some compilation units.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>From my interpretation, the specification for
<code class="llattr">nounwind</code> guarantees that the function will
neither throw an exception nor unwind the stack, i.e.
<code class="llattr">nounwind</code> = <code class="myattr">no-throw</code> +
<code class="myattr">no-unwind</code>.  The specification for
<code class="llattr">uwtable</code> guarantees <em>some</em> unwind table
will be generated; however, it does not specify which kind of unwind table
should be generated.  IIRC, the ARM backend actually implements
<code class="myattr">ehtable</code>, which has only limited capability to
unwind the stack.</p>

	<h3>Inconsistant Interpretation of nounwind</h3>

	<p>The things are getting tricky when it comes to the
implementation.  There is a <code>PruneEH</code> pass, which will
try to remove the unnecessary exception handling informantion.  For example,
the following code:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">define void @foo() {
entry:
  ret void
}</pre>

	<p>will be converted to:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">define void @foo() <strong>nounwind</strong> {
entry:
  ret void
}</pre>

	<p>Here's a much more complex example:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">define void @foo() {

declare void @_Z3barv()

declare i32 @__gxx_personality_v0(...)

define void @_Z3foov() {
entry:
  invoke void @_Z3barv() to label %try.cont unwind label %lpad

lpad:
  %0 = landingpad { i8*, i32 } personality i8* bitcast (i32 (...)* @__gxx_personality_v0 to i8*)
          catch i8* null
  ret void

try.cont:
  ret void
}</pre>

	<p>is converted to</p>

<pre class="codeblock">declare void @_Z3barv()

declare i32 @__gxx_personality_v0(...)

<strong>; Function Attrs: nounwind</strong>
define void @_Z3foov() <strong>#0</strong> {
entry:
  invoke void @_Z3barv()
          to label %try.cont unwind label %lpad

lpad:
  %0 = landingpad { i8*, i32 } personality i8* bitcast (i32 (...)* @__gxx_personality_v0 to i8*)
          catch i8* null
  ret void

try.cont:
  ret void
}

<strong>attributes #0 = { nounwind }</strong></pre>

	<p>Some careful reader might have noticed the problem here.  The
<code class="llattr">nounwind</code> attribute is added to
<code>@_Z3foov()</code> simply because the <code>landingpad</code> can
catch the exception object.  However, in my notation, only
<code class="myattr">no-throw</code> can be added to this function, and
<code class="myattr">no-throw</code> does not imply
<code class="myattr">no-unwind</code>.  It is possible for
<code>@_Z3foov()</code> to unwind the stack.  For example, the function
<code>@_Z3barv()</code> may call <code>_Unwind_Backtrace()</code> to get the
backtrace.</p>

	<p>Besides, some optimization might make the situation even worse.
AFAIK, most of the stack unwinding implementations rely on the value in
the <em>link register</em> or the <em>return address</em> on the stack.
However, there is an optimization in LLVM code generation which will not
save the link register if the callee function has
<code class="llattr">noreturn</code> attribute [<a href="#footnote1">1</a>].
Even though the optimization will only be applied when the callee function has
<code class="llattr">nounwind</code> attribute as well, the problem still
occurs because <code>PruneEH</code> will (incorrectly) add <code
class="llattr">nounwind</code> to some function which actually unwinds.
Besides, I am in doubt about whether we can apply this optimization when the
caller function has the <code class="llattr">uwtable</code> attribute and
requires the unwind table.</p>


	<h3>Unwind Table and Can't Unwind</h3>

	<p>The mixture of <code class="llattr">uwtable</code> and <code
class="llattr">nounwind</code> will cause another problem.</p>

	<p>IMO, it is incorrect to decide whether to emit
<code>[can't unwind]</code> with <code>!needsUnwindTableEntry()</code>
[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>].  The <code>needsUnwindTableEntry()</code> is
defined as either the function has <code class="llattr">uwtable</code>
attribute or the function does not have <code class="llattr">nounwind</code>.
Thus, <code>!needsUnwindTableEntry()</code> imples not having <code
class="llattr">uwtable</code> attribute <em>and</em> having <code
class="llattr">nounwind</code>.  As the result, the <code>[can't unwind]</code>
won't be generated for the following function:</p>

<pre>define void @foo() uwtable nounwind {
entry:
  call void @bar()
  ret void
}</pre>

	<p>The stack unwinder might continue to unwind the stack because there
isn't any mark in the unwind table to stop the stack unwinding.  And,
unfortunately, according to the <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">
LLVM reference manual</a>, this will result in undefined behavior.
In fact, I did encounter some real example [<a href="#footnote3">3</a>]
which will fall into an infinite loop during the phase 1 unwinding.</p>

	<h2>Summary</h2>

	<p>In conclusion, I would like to suggest that we need to put more
efforts to define a precise specification for exception handling and
stack unwinding mechanism, so that the optimization passes and the
run-time environment can interact with each other without problems.</p>

	<p>In summary, IMO, these are the topic have to be discussed:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Should we separate <code class="llattr">nounwind</code>
into <code class="myattr">no-throw</code> and
<code class="myattr">no-unwind</code>?</li>

		<ul>
			<li>What is the impact in terms of the run-time performance?</li>
			<li>What is the impact on the code size?</li>
		</ul>

		<li>Should we write more implementation details about
<code class="llattr">uwtable</code> in the
<a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html"> LLVM reference manual</a>?</li>

		<ul>
			<li>What is the possible expected behavior when <code
class="llattr">uwtable</code> is used with <code
class="llattr">nounwind</code></li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>If we have some decision, I am willing to write the patch. :-)</p>
