After using `Blogger`_ for several years, I decided to switch to `Pelican`_ and
`GitHub Pages`_.  I feel it will be much easier to write down my thoughts,
notes, and ideas with reStructuredText.  As a result, I can update the blog
more frequently.

In the foreseeable future, I will start to write some C++ related articles.
Stay tuned!  :-)
